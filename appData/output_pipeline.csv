Now they're encouraging people to become more involved with their mission by teaching younger people how to code.

The user will be logged into their e-mail account, if such a session was opened before last exit. The previous ""save tabs"" option upon exit did not suffer from this security vulnerability because only the webpage addresses were saved but not the sessions themselves.

So I downloaded Firefox again, and when I saved the 2nd download file, it named itself Firefox Installer(2) as if it was replacing the exact same file and file name.

However, last week, for some reason everytime I open Facebook and scroll down, after three/four scrolls, the facebook website hangs for mere 3 seconds, the webpage refreshes itself, then my CPU fan starts to go faster and so does the CPU performance. The facebook website scrolls signifcantly slower after that automatic ""refresh"" - which is more like a ""white flash"".  I have also made a performance recording through Web Developer tools in Firefox, and am happy to send that in if provided with an email address. Kindly please have a look into this because I am on the verge of switching to Chrome - which, to be very honest, would be quite a painful thing to do for me.   I would also like to add that I'm running the latest Firefox PC version, and have updated it recently, however the problem persisted regardless of the latest update.

Cameras of all kinds are out there, but if there is a panic button, that a crime can be seen and recorded, even if the cell phone gets stomped(destroyed) by he criminal or any others having agenda.  That would be a neat thingy to develop, now SCOTUS says cell phones can be used, just do not get in the way of police.  But at victim level, it might be even more critical evidence, getting a close-up picture of who to arrest and prosecute.  Or if such person believes that his picture has been taken, might break-off for now; however, the encounter could lead to police and court action to stop the criminal officially.  Neat things are innovation at FireFox, and maybe the first, staying leader in things done for citizens which are useful and things of value.

80771,5004150,2018-11-01 16:06:00,English,Australia,Sad,http://www.speedtest.net/,"Hello  It seems that my recent upgrade to Firefox v63.0.1 running on Mac OSX v10.9.5 (and using a MacBook Pro, 15-inch, Mid 2010 model, with a 2.53 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 of memory) has resulted in a serious downgrade in performance.  In particular, if I compare the performance of Firefox v63.0.1 to Google Chrome v67.0.3396.87 (Official Build) (64-bit) for the speedtest website (see provided URL), I am able to complete the speedtest using Google Chrome but the speedtest aborts almost immediately after I click on ""Go"" using Firefox.   This is running over my home WiFi.   Webpages are slow or problematic to load, and so this makes doing any Internet-based work unreliable and unproductive.  I forget what my previous version of Firefox was that ran acceptably over my WiFi, but I only upgraded to v63 this week (Tuesday?), although there was another earlier update already downloaded onto my computer but not yet installed that was installed just before I installed v63. The only other information I can think to provide is that it is possible my previously acceptably working version of Firefox was version fifty-something (e.g. 57??) or maybe it was as recent as v60 or 61, but I never took note, so this is only a guess. I'm sure the version was not older than an early or mid-50's version.  Firefox has been my preferred browser for ages, and I would like to continue this way of operating, but the present situation is wasting time I cannot afford to waste. I need things to improve.  I am wondering if the content blocker could be an issue, as this is the most obvious new feature provided with my most recent Firefox upgrade. I generally visit a very restricted number of websites (I don't surf as a rule, mainly visit trusted websites for my e-mail, the weather, paying bills, etc., also including facebook).   Is it possible the content blocker is seriously degrading the performance of my Web browsing in general over WiFi, and the reason why the speedtest aborted?  Note also, if I bypass my WiFi by connecting a Cat 6 ethernet cable to my router (this is not a practical way for me to operate as a rule), then I can successfully complete the speedtest using Firefox v63. So it seems that there is a particular problem with the Firefox v63 using WiFi.  The details of my router are as follows: belkin Wi-Fi DUAL-BAND AC+ Gigabit Router (AC 1200 DB). Usually I work over the standard band, which is designed to deliver up to 300 Mbps (2.4GHz), which suffices for e-mail, and Web browsing. It is precisely these functions which are no longer performing reliably.

I never leave anything on the OS that I don't want the demons to get..  All my new science notes goes into notebooks which are never Net-connected.. All that's in this Windows notebook is fun pix, music, a few interesting YouTube videos, and my latest activism notes..  At the end of the day, everything new in the Surface goes into a flash chip, and is transferred to a Toshiba 1-terra external hd, then erased from the notebook, and CCleaner run..  It's always an empty OS, save for pix and music.. Would be nice if Firefox didn't save anything that needed to be cleaned up..  I dislike backups in the OS.. Backups slow down the OS, and waste space.. It's probably backups which allow some things to be compromised.. Why should I have to forever be erasing unwanted backups..  I never use those backups for anything... All my valuable data is in three ext hd's, and in Ubuntu and Scientific Linux private secret notebooks, which are net-connected only for updates at 3:AM..   I am authoring five university courses: 'BBE The Philosophy of Psychiatry', 'Map to Immortality', 'How to crack the bonds of the inert elements to the tune of 200-million new chemical compounds', 'How to build a Liquid Electricity Emitter (plazma rocket')', 'How to erase all disease from humanity..  But the way this world is going, it seems humanity is devolving into apes..  No one can understand any of these thousands of new sciences I hold..  I am considering taking this box of notes and courses out into the backyard, and burning them, but it's humanity's future..  I'm stuck at ""Rock & HardPlace"" it seems..  There seems to be no more love and reality left in humanity..  Are there any good people left on planet earth?..  I am ascendant..

I have it to teach how to establish your own mindform dragon, and fly it a mile up around the world.. We don't need aircraft.. Humanity can't handle this much reality..  I haven't found anyone worth teaching..  Humanity was created by the nephilim giants by their inseminating chimps..  The first human's birth mother was a chimpanzee..  Our DNA proves it...  We were created by aliens for meat.. Researchers are finding the alien's human bone dumps and huge stew pots and the escape-proof enclosures where human meat animals were housed.. Humanity seems to be devolving back into alien meat-monkeys..  They won't let me repair this planet..  The global asylum of mindless brainfried cocaine addicts stifle my work daily..  They fear new stuff because it forces them to think.. Thinking gives them headaches..  They blame the new science on their headaches.. I have it to repair this planet's life-support systems..

And, when I use Chrome I get the same vibe that I get when I use Facebook or other applications that represent a decline in privacy.  I know it's silly because in the end it's all the same whether you're using a safer browser or not. It just feels better not using Chrome.

It's a little bit like candy. 20 years ago candy companies we're all kind of different and they used sugar, which is bad but it's not as bad as today. All the candy companies have merged, and they all use corn syrup. So when I had kids to try American candy. When we did, we were disappointed by the flavor. They like it and ask me why I thought it was so great. And I didn't recognize the flavor and texture. Big Brands mean well but in the end they are just simply cloying and bad for your health.

IE11 and Chrome72 both perform the download test correctly on this site.  FF performs the download test correctly when going to a different (but similar Ookla private-label) test site, such as http://losangeles.ca.speedtest.frontier.com/ . In a cursory review of Wireshark tracing, the working Frontier download test seems to use regular HTTP requests.  The broken download from Level3 seems to use WebSocket protocol.  But, my rudimentary knowledge of these protocols may cause this part of the report to be a red herring.  [Not knowing exactly what I am looking at: it appears that the websockets download first successfully requests 100,000.  When that finishes, it appears to request 1,000,000.  It sends the request three or four times with no response from the far end, and then the TCP connection is dropped.  Again, I am unfamiliar with websocket operation, so my report may be misleading.] When it works, FF achieves much higher speed test results than IE or Chrome.

If you guys could have something like the Feedback Assistant app in macOS, that would be great! That app collects diagnostic information, allows you to attach screenshot and other supporting documents to your description of the issue. The issues you create are categorized by app/subsystem. There are a few questions they ask depending on the chosen category. You can see the history and details of all the feedback you submitted.  In other words, they make it easier for you to report, they guide you through the whole process and you can tell, they take the whole thing a lot more seriously.  They also have a developer portal on apple.com where you can submit issues and get responses. And it's much easier to use than Bugzilla.  I think you should up you game if you want to get quality feedback, rather than a brain dump in the form of a giant wall of text where a person describes everything they want fixed/improved in Firefox in one go.

It is not easy to strike a balance. Until recently some browsers excelled at one of these but not others whereas others were outstanding with certain features but not with others. However, recently Firefox has certainly come out on top. At least to me it does strike that important balance. It's strength is being non-commercial which sets a fairly unbiased agenda for developing it for the benefit of users rather than profit. I returned to Firefox from having had a stint with Opera, which I also think has many redeeming features for much the same reason. But compatibility lacked. It had one feature though which I thoght very neat and I hope that this could possibly be considered for Firefox as well. Opera allows users to design their browser desktop with a variety of features and graphics. Firefox only allows the user to design the top section according to taste and available designs leaving the rest of the browser surface very dull. Why not adopt an idea similar to that of Opera: allow Firefox users an improved possibility of personalizing not only visible functions (which is already done to perfection) but also affectimng how the browser actually looks aesthetically on the computer desktop whilst being used.

That the growth over time is 40MB would be annoying but not terribly significant in the grand scheme of things, but it means my profile has tripled in size over seemingly no actual change. Combine this with how hard it is to set caps on how much a site is allowed to store locally and for how long, and profiles easily balloon without regular routine maintenance.  I would appreciate if local Firefox pages that aren't showing anything anyway would stop bothering to waste space doing nothing, and on a related note it would be incredibly handy to be able to cap the data that sites try to silently store to prevent the scenario where (I actually had to deal with this today) a site might decide it can locally store 50MB on your first visit regardless of whether you ever intend to return, and set that data to just hang around until you notice it.",,[],"['Performance', 'Generic Bug']","['Firefox', 'History/cookies/cache', 'Color']",0.3035

It's user friendly, has a clean layout that's pleasing to the eye and with it's smooth scrolling and vivid colors is a pleasure to use.  However, it was only when I started coding that I realized the advantages of using Firefox over other browsers.  A server-side scripting language needs an IDE to work. I installed AMPSS (the IDE) on my computer to code and run PHP (the scripting language).  Firefox proved to be blindingly fast in executing files from the local host (127.0.0.1) and the results were consistent and predictable.   Two significant factors arise from this:  1. Development time is minimized.  2. Confidence level is high when coding.  Running the same files on Chrome and IE had very different results.  Chrome was slower.  And the results were inconsistent.  Sometimes Chrome would reflect the changes to the code and sometimes it wouldn't.  The latter usually happens when the cache fills up. A clearing is then required for the browser to perform properly.  Development time is increased.  Confidence level is low because when you expect a change to occur and it doesn't, you're not sure if the cause is in your code or in the browser itself.  IE is rubbish. We all know this so I won't belabor the point.  But, Firefox isn't perfect. There tends to be a slight ""jump"" during screen refresh as  code executes.  This is a minuscule price to pay in the face of all the other good stuff Mozilla throws my way. For FREE!

I believe it's called a ""leak"" or something like that (it's hogging all my laptop's resources and slowing it down to a crawl!)  And the browser itself is becoming useless.  For example, about 15 minutes ago, I tried to open two separate website links.  Waited and waited and the browser just kept ""spinning its wheels"".  In frustration, (while waiting) I opened the Google chrome browser, opened tabs and copied/pasted the same links to the websites I was wanting from Firefox and boom, boom....there they were!  In the meantime, Firefox is STILL SPINNING ITS WHEELS DOING NOTHING.  I know its not my connection because there was no problem connecting using Chrome!

Up came a proper list of 250 megabytes of Ubuntu updates for this UbuntuStudio-16...  Was that unidentified 17.7 meg download a hack trying to get me install spyware..?  If it was a hack, how can that path be erased or secured..? Tell us how does the user make Ubuntu secure against the global asylum's demon-apes hack-attacks..?

I found data on encryption, cloud, switching power supplies, military data, and computer stuff I still can't label..

Everything is done online and there are clipboard managers out there, although, it'd be neat if encrypted and saved personal resume info could be right clicked and the user could go through menus then sub menus(ie. ::user right clicks in a txt box:: ***if option is selected in the options to show this tool...etc....*** then display a new selection [Field Filler]>>opens submenu array list of different types of fields that may be entered.

84470,5025944,2018-11-05 06:00:31,English,United States,Happy,,"Love Firefox.   My real, decades old issue with Mozilla involves Thunderbird. Thunderbird's inability to optimally support Gmail's ""conversation"" message format is huge, considering that just about everyone uses Gmail. Thunderbird seems to massively duplicate the emails in a specific Gmail conversation. I recognize that fixing this is not a trivial project, but fixing it will help Thunderbird's market penetration a lot.   Thunderbird also desperately needs export and import options on the Thunderbird File pulldown. Cross-platform compatibility between Windows and Linux is important to me. I see no reason why Thunderbird could not export the required files in a single backup package that could be re-imported on any platform. True, this import/export operation can be done now, but doing it is a rather tedious pain.   The first need here is to easily export and clone a Thunderbird database onto another machine without doing anything sexier than that. The ability to merge a database from one machine into the DB of another machine would be useful but is a much lower priority than is the ability to EASILY clone Thunderbird email DBs across machines. In short, the ability to merge would require much work and has much less payoff than does cloning.  Although I have not checked recently, Thunderbird historically has been effectively a closed architecture product with respect to Outlook in that any reasonable bi-directional interoperability between the two clients simply did not exist. Outlook is a major piece of the email client market. At its core, a basic interoperability with Outlook is just another import/export issue.  Back in the day, a reasonably open architecture built Microsoft, while an obsession with closed architecture nearly killed Apple in its early days. As open an architecture as can be built will only help Thunderbird gain market penetration against other email clients.",,"['Gmail', 'Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Outlook']","['Crashes', 'Layout Bugs', 'Not Supported', 'Generic Bug', 'Security']","['Firefox', 'Color']",0.9793

While running, FF is perfectly stable so I don't know why it would have random start up problems. Happens with both nightly and on regular firefox on my mac. I don't want to use safe mode. I want it looking all pretty and functional with my plugins too. I don't want to reset all my settings (again). I've already done that. Did nothing, except leave me annoyed at needing to set my whole browser up again. Each time I see this box, I'm tempted to just go back to Safari as although it's not as nice, it just works. Some days I can't get firefox to start because I click FF the Safe Mode warning box appears... I click to close it, Firefox closes. Rinse and repeat till I get tired of it (and so have to use Safari or my iPhone or other macs for net) or it launches and I need to reopen tabs. Really kills the whole joy of use on the days I can't just use my Firefox or Firefox Nightly.  Years ago the inability to just start and use firefox (because this box kept popping up preventing me from simply using FF) and Safari's big developments in Mac OS 10.8 caused me to jump ship for a good 4 years. Took a lot to get me off Safari as it smoothly integrates with my iPhone and mac photos.  With version ~47 Firefox I tried it again and finding that it didn't appear to stop me from using it with this dumb box popping up at luanch, I got a good half year or more of use out of my fave web browser before this began to occasonly appear. After a while, I grew tired of it again and tried resetting my settings. Toally did Nothing. Seeing that afer all these years, the problem still exists makes me sad. Can't there be a option to bypass this box and just relaunch problem tabs or something of the kind? I want Firefox to just relanch my tabs where and how they were each time, without wasting my time with a dumb Safe Mode box that I don't want to see. Some days, I get tempted to go back to safari's less pretty but more stable use. Yes, I primarily use Nightly, cause its pretty icon and seeing what new stuff comes with its updates is enjoyable, but surely its odd bugs can't be consistently driving it into needing Safe Mode most days of the week..???",,[],"['Performance', 'Crashes', 'Layout Bugs', 'Regressions', 'Generic Bug', 'Security']","['Firefox', 'Slowness', 'Color']",0.9764

And then the add on doesn't always appear when the hanging Firefox is closed and re-opened. So even once installed it's pretty much impossible to use the add on.  LastPass, for instance, can't run because Firefox hangs if I try to use LastPass.  It hangs when I do incredibly complicate things like click on the menu burger.  It regularly hangs just when I'm on a page that auto-refreshes, like that of the Jenkins CI.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox.  Same behaviour.

Would you be kind to send me the compatible firefox version for my  iMac OSX 10.6.8 and or the compatible FlashPlayer so I continue  my banking on line?

Firefox has been a great experience so far for me and has been my web browser of choice until recently, as I have run into a couple of issues:  When attempting to play any form of audio or video through Firefox no audio is present - Firefox does not seem to recognise my audio interface (Motu 828mk3 if that's useful to you!), despite the fact that all other audio on my Mac plays through it and other web browsers (safari, chrome) play audio through it just fine. Also, when playing any videos on YouTube the control bar at the bottom of the video and the region containing the search bar above the video continuously flickers. Would you guys happen to know why this is happening?

I know how hard it is to make everyone happy and FF lives up to very high standards in other regards. But I think this needs to be seriously adressed. So forgive me if I step on any toes now, it's not at all my intention.  The menus are _very_ confusing. On iOS it just goes bananas.  Most of the options in the meatball-menu (the three horizontal dots in the adress-field) can be found within the share sheet of iOS. It's already confusing finding a different way of navigating in an ecosystem as iOS, have any other commonly used app used this way of navigating? But now you have the same things twice! Are you playing with trick-questions? Please stop doing that.  The available space in the adress-field is very *very* limited. I use a iPhoneSE, it's tiny and I knew I would suffer. But please don't make this harder on me than it needs to be! 3 functions in one (1!) corner.   I can 1 - write a new adress, 2 - the menu and 3 - access the bookmarks etc AND a QR-code-reader!? There is a QR-reader built into the camera already + there are apps for this!! I wouldn't go to this hidden corner and try to hit that microscopic icon to get anywhere. Ever!  *For the love of god, I have small hands but I'm not a machine!*   I have a million ways to tap the wrong part here and this app will just leave me with a sense annoyance in the best case in the worse case with a sense of defeat. Is that really what we want?   I encourage yout to try out the distance between all these tiny tiny icons yourself. Test also on a smaller phone. Better yet: put it in the hands of someone that has shaky hands and lower vision. I'm in a place that is gets darkness at three in the afternoon for the better part of the year. It's dark and also cold. I don't have heat to spare trying to hit the right buttons.   Please also make some hard decisions on where to access things, right now it's very difficult to navigate the app. The menus appear very alike and with lower cognitive capabilities it's already hard to even tell which button you pressed, the result appears to be the same. Getting an overload of choices that are the same as the users are familiar with feels somewhat evil.

Disconnecting wifi manually does not trigger it.  I have observed it happening when the only tabs I have open are all-text pages. I have also observed it happening while complex webgames are running, and in those scenarios it does not seem like anything running is actually interrupted, just that I am locked out of it while the browser hangs on some unknown issue. The screen remains frozen and the mouse icon changes to the loading icon for the duration of the event. Then it just snaps out of it and continues like normal.  The addons I am running are uBlock Origin, uMatrix, Foxy Gestures, and Context Search, though I don't suspect any of them are the culprit because I have been using them all far longer than this started. The problem is not so frequent and reproducible that I could productively run the browser without addons and measure if it is happening or not, because as I said, it seems to have something to do with my network connection dropping, and that is out of my control.",,[],"['Performance', 'Crashes', 'Generic Bug', 'Security']","['Firefox', 'Crashes', 'Color']",-0.8371

In Home, the chat bar runs top to bottom full length.   This used to be the case even when clicking on, say, an article, or someone else's timeline.  Clicking on the reduced size chat bar does not extend it to its full length.   Frustratingly, scrolling doesn't let you the entire content!  Two other problems I have encountered, again each with Facebook and for these, I do not know if the problems are with Facebook, Firefox or elsewhere.  Nevertheless, here is what I have experienced:  Occasionally, whilst running Facebook, a Facebook-looking popup window has appeared telling me to log in to Facebook when I was not logged out!   Hitting the escape button or clicking outside of this popup window clears it from view.  And finally, another popup, again on Facebook.   Occasionally a barrage of ""Are you sure you wish to leave this page"" popups have appeared. I say barrage because clicking ""stay on page"" would have the popup disappear, only for another to reappear a couple of seconds later. On one day it got so bad I restarted the computer.  This popup window prevented me from accessing what I was writing and I had no facility to select and copy it for later use either - hence my comment below.  Both the: log in and the: Are you sure you wish to leave this page, popups are intermittent.   The possibility of some form of interference from a third party did cross my mind.

I am sorry if this isn't your fault, but when using Firefox Quantum 63.0.1 (64-bit), I encounter a problem, which isn't happening when using Chrome or Microsoft Edge. If i try to google some images, i type in something in the search bar. Results with images come up normally. I can scroll up and down completely fine. But when i click on an image, the picture i click appears in the right part of the page (with Chrome or Edge, a big gray background would split the page in two and the picture will appear there), but the actual problem is, that scrolling with my mouse wheel becomes extremely slow and annoying after this has happened. Each scroll wheel rotation (not a full 360, but just until it clicks in place) will only scroll by 10 pixels or so, which is WAY slower than any scrolling I've ever done in my life. If i want to scroll down just to show an extra row of images, i need to spin the wheel as hard as i can 7 times, compared to the scrolling in Chrome and Edge, where 7 scrolls would mean scrolling past AT LEAST 15 rows of images. I haven't encountered anything like this in any other website using Firefox before.

The Senate offers TTY service, participates in the Minnesota Relay Service, and has assistive listening  devices in hearing rooms, the House Chamber, and the Senate Chamber. For assistance with any other special  needs, please call the Senate Sergeant at Arms at (voice) 651-296-1119 or toll free 1-888-234-1112; or (TTY)  651-296-0250 or toll free 1-888-234-1216. The House of Representatives Sergeant at Arms can be contacted at  (voice) 651-296-4860 or toll free 1-800-657-3550; or (TTY) 651-296-9896 or toll free 1-800-657-3550. The Minnesota Legislature is committed to complying with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities  Act and supports the goal that individuals with disabilities shall not be excluded from participating in or be denied  the benefi ts of any program, service or activity offered by the legislature. Effective communication is a necessary  step in meeting that goal. Thus, the legislature welcomes comments and suggestions from the public on services  that will improve communication between the legislature and individuals with special needs.

Eventually I open an email address at Lester Vance at mail.com. I'm running to open a a Thunderbird email system. I suggest you just have a selection to open a single Thunderbird email account. Upon attempting to send you my frustration I also discovered another guest account in my Firefox settings side panel. I don't know how this person gained access but I would like it removed and I do not see a manner or method by which this can be done. Please send me your thoughts or suggestions to Lester Vance at mail.com. By the way I do not wish to have any further connection with Google or Gmail except for the obligatory Gmail account for the Google Play Store. I have seen several YouTube videos  on how to eliminate from Android  the necessary  Google  connections to enter or receive  apps from the Play Store . This is what I intend to do.

Lastly, when attempting to reach someone within the home base for Software Search (i.e., TheFreeWindows.com), there was NO LINK to a Contact/ Contact Us window for this home base.

A combination of principles I share, such as an open web or the open source philosophy. Of ease of use, of stability, of speed and simplicity.

So thank you for existing. No matter how much the rest of the web (and the world) seems to be headed on a different path, I am glad to see that there are still a few communities like yours offering a different, fresher mindset, which I feel is direly missing in our world.

Subsequently, I reasoned that my site access details must be retained for the duration of my Firefox session, whereas I would have previously deleted them mid-session e.g. immediately after concluding a bank transaction. As Shift Ctrl Del history clearance is disabled when history retention is disabled, I turned my history back on again only to discover that site details were retained from a month before when I had chosen to try turning history off. So, in principle, it seems that sensitive details could be retained without knowledge if Firefox history is turned off. Should they be cleared automatically if history is turned off, or the history clearance functionality remain enabled?

A more lengthy explanation is that family group of child molesters did fixate on my son when he was a child and have been stalking and raping him and others for over forty years. I was in fact the eye witness to most likely the first time they victimized him at two years old and they have continued to victimize him and our family ever since then. They are involved in rape, kidnapping, murder, human trafficking falsification of government documents and likely several other felony activities. Also unfortunately the entire time they have been in areas of law enforcement and public office and we have been turned away by that group and many of their accomplices with them claiming we had no evidence even though we have plenty (both eye witness and physical evidence at times though they have used their authority to enter many different jurisdictional locations and be the persons that spoke with us instead of the usual police even though we have no idea how they get away with it, (sometimes even claiming to be making a movie though). We know this is happening as my son can identify many of their family group from the many times they victimized him and about twenty others and I myself have seen very unusual behavior from so called investigators). They have been planning and carrying out the plan of framing my son for their many crimes starting over ten years ago by falsifying documents of mental health issues on my son that he doesn't actually have, and accusing him of crimes he didn't commit. This group has in short done everything humanly possible to get away with and continue to victimize us, their other victims and their own children, as they continue to sell/groom them as  human trafficking victims/domestic terrorists in this manner and use law enforcement offices as both hiding places and terrorist organizations to the point of us not being protected at all for over fifteen years and contrary to popular opinion we would still like to trust the various departments to protect us from that group, unfortunately we are still being terrorized with the guilty murderers beating on the walls at night as we try to sleep, destroying our vehicles by removing the oil, water and other fluids from our engines, stealing the vehicles, using heavy equipment to bend the body and even the frame of the vehicles and returning them to the driveway, drugging my son inside grocery stores, and raping him at his work places. My son doesn't entertain the idea of telling lies or starting problems. We are in danger now and have been for some time. We have given up the idea of the police rescuing us or even investigating the many times we have reported all the vehicle tampering to cause an accident and harassment (their family and friends live here, as we have been told in the past (everyone in Roswell Mill / Hanstead Square except us apparently). In total my son has seen enough for the witness protection program and has seen uniformed police raping children several times in two different jurisdictions for over twenty years. We are completely separated from normal society in a manner that can't be externally seen and we have no way to solve this problem as the group has a very large number of accomplices in every area including the postal service. Were there is no justice there is anarchy, were there is anarchy criminals flourish. We need assistance and we need it now, this group has tried to make us have ""accidents"" several times and they have no jurisdictional issues and are able to take over state and local police departments at will and have allied security (who guard the FBI buildings) doing as they are told or involved. This goes very far and we are in need of assistance now. We haven't been able to get free of this group ever, we can't go anywhere without them following us and we have been everywhere to ask for assistance with no help, we have very little money.

Main beef is that when opening a series of web pages in sequential tabs, they stack to the right. When closing them in reverse series, the first time Control-W is used, the correct sequence of next tab to the Left closes. Second time a page is closed, the tab to the RIGHT closes, which isn't in the immediate past sequence, and is IRRITATING. Safari gets this right. The only fix I have found is to only open sequences of tabs in a window with No presently open tabs to the Right of the first tab in the sequence. An irritation I prefer to avoid when possible.

93178,5078952,2018-11-14 02:21:27,English,South Africa,Sad,,"The current Firefox is a distinct disappointment.  I first met FF in the AmigaFormat when it was still a very tiny puppy in 1990 somewhere.  That dates me;  Oh , just an oldie that cannot crack it.  Wrong.  I bought my Amiga A500 in 1987 with the express purpose of being able to program in C.  I bought Kernighan & Ritchie's C bible in 1983!  The VAX 11 was just too expensive.  Firefox was the ideal part of my stated philosophy of using non-Microsoft apps as it had a built-in firewall. And avoided the ActiveX issue.  Ditto Thunderbird.  Prepared me for not ever going on the Net without protection.  This was on a Win 98 machine.  From FF12 onwards I battled with Flash Player issues.  I knew about Seamonkey but avoided it since I was unsure of it.  By FF27 the Flash issue finally had me going nuts.  Thunderbird had already then shown dating in that clicking on any link to any website caused a crash -  not opening Firefox!  Enter Seamonkey and I have never been disappointed.  Easy, sensible, highly productive!  I used my Motorola Razr V3 on Virgin Mobile as a modem but our internet charges were astronomical.  Could not do much.  You see, in 1979 I did the Control Data Institute High Level Programming Languages course for a career in computers.  Not IT then.  We were taught that software had to answer to four criteria.  Easy to write.       -  for the line coder. Easy to read.        -  not designed for the special interest group. Easy to maintain.  - for the IT tech coming after you. Easy to use.          -  for the Microsoft type user.  You now fail in this last criterion.  Please do not tell me you are doing it for the current style of user and the Android thingy.  You are skimping on resources and it seems unwilling to put your money into additional programmers, sorry developers.  Having used IBM AT/XT's in office environments, the Control-Key tapping sequences to get anywhere soon got one numb.  Oh yes, that while I had my Amiga with a mouse at home!  Seamonkey beats you hands down in ease of use and efficiency, especially in making interaction between e-mail and response on the Net a doodle. Seamless!  Transparent!!  Sheer bliss!  Firefox now forces me back to 1990 with having to remember clicking key sequences to find anything, very Microsoft.  Don't tell me MS went open source, still the same corporate mentality.  Just another trick to suck open source into the corporate maelstrom.  Whatever made you guys split FF and TB!!???  I have now finally achieved a life-long dream, doing IT programming.  I just dread having to make my web development work on Firefox.  What's so fantastic about being a cognoscento anyway?  Aah!  Now I get it.  You blinked, like Coca-Cola did against Pepsi-Cola and then lost the market.  Bummer!  You are programming for the box, not the user.  Ouch!

So, I'll consider a new version.  But:  (1) You never say what the version is of the newest version I would download today.  I very much want to know version numbers so that I can know what I have and if make a HUGE mistake and get some 'automatic updates', which I NEVER want for any software ever (I could lose days to weeks for no good reason), I will want to know how to return to what I had before the 'update' so will want to know the version..  (2) It is not clear if the current download program just downloads the latest version, and three years from now would also download the latest version then, or if the current download program will forever download only the version it downloads now, will forever download only that one version.  I very, Very, VERY much want to know.  PLEASE be totally clear, unambiguous, and explicit on this important point.  (3) Is there a way to have both versions 52.2.1 and some later version BOTH able to run on my one operating system instance?  Maybe not at the same time -- fine with me.  I very, Very, VERY much want to know.  I have hundreds of programs on my computers, and I'm very much ready to have multiple versions of Firefox on my computers, e.g., if I prefer one over another for some purposes, for testing the Web pages in the Web site I'm developing, etc.  PLEASE let multiple versions of Firefox able to be installed and run on some one computer.  PLEASE.  It is clear that Mozilla likes the latest version; I rarely like the latest version of any software.  (4) I see that the version of Firefox now will 'arrange' multiple Firefox windows with the upper left corners on a line from the upper left to the lower right.  PLEASE, think a little and then conclude that very, Very, VERY much better is to have those corners on a line from the upper right to the lower left.  Why:  With my suggestion, no matter what the Z-order of the windows is, we will always be able to see the titles of ALL the windows.  With your solution, if make one of the Firefox windows come to the top of the Z-order, then the titles of ALL the windows lower on the screen will be covered and invisible.  PLEASE.

A more lengthy explanation is that family group of child molesters did fixate on my son when he was a child and have been stalking and raping him and others for over forty years. I was in fact the eye witness to most likely the first time they victimized him at two years old and they have continued to victimize him and our family ever since then. They are involved in rape, kidnapping, murder, human trafficking falsification of government documents and likely several other felony activities. Also unfortunately the entire time they have been in areas of law enforcement and public office and we have been turned away by that group and many of their accomplices with them claiming we had no evidence even though we have plenty (both eye witness and physical evidence at times though they have used their authority to enter many different jurisdictional locations and be the persons that spoke with us instead of the usual police even though we have no idea how they get away with it, (sometimes even claiming to be making a movie though). We know this is happening as my son can identify many of their family group from the many times they victimized him and about twenty others and I myself have seen very unusual behavior from so called investigators). They have been planning and carrying out the plan of framing my son for their many crimes starting over ten years ago by falsifying documents of mental health issues on my son that he doesn't actually have, and accusing him of crimes he didn't commit. This group has in short done everything humanly possible to get away with and continue to victimize us, their other victims and their own children, as they continue to sell/groom them as  human trafficking victims/domestic terrorists in this manner and use law enforcement offices as both hiding places and terrorist organizations to the point of us not being protected at all for over fifteen years and contrary to popular opinion we would still like to trust the various departments to protect us from that group, unfortunately we are still being terrorized with the guilty murderers beating on the walls at night as we try to sleep, destroying our vehicles by removing the oil, water and other fluids from our engines, stealing the vehicles, using heavy equipment to bend the body and even the frame of the vehicles and returning them to the driveway, drugging my son inside grocery stores, and raping him at his work places. My son doesn't entertain the idea of telling lies or starting problems. We are in danger now and have been for some time. We have given up the idea of the police rescuing us or even investigating the many times we have reported all the vehicle tampering to cause an accident and harassment (their family and friends live here, as we have been told in the past (everyone in Roswell Mill / Hanstead Square except us apparently). In total my son has seen enough for the witness protection program and has seen uniformed police raping children several times in two different jurisdictions for over twenty years. We are completely separated from normal society in a manner that can't be externally seen and we have no way to solve this problem as the group has a very large number of accomplices in every area including the postal service. Were there is no justice there is anarchy, were there is anarchy criminals flourish. We need assistance and we need it now, this group has tried to make us have ""accidents"" several times and they have no jurisdictional issues and are able to take over state and local police departments at will and have allied security (who guard the FBI buildings) doing as they are told or involved. This goes very far and we are in need of assistance now. We haven't been able to get free of this group ever, we can't go anywhere without them following us and we have been everywhere to ask for assistance with no help, we have very little money.

This is a shortcoming as surfing is slower and troublesome using at a small android screen. It will not be possible to use up the large data quota given offered by the ISP to the android phone accounts. At present most ISP offer very generous (unlimited) data quota at a very low price to android phone but not the PC. The ISP  limits the hotspot and USB tattering  to only the basic quota of the internet plan.  Hotspot and USB Tattering are barred from using the generous bonus quota (100 GB / Unlimited)  given every month. If  Morzila  can develop a  free mirroring software that  enable accessing the Andoid's  Browsers in large Desktop PC screen,  them it would be great for cost saving.

Previous versions, of all web content and browsers, immediately gave the focus to the keyboard.   Now you must switch from the keyboard to the mouse, left click in a blank area somewhere on the new web page, and then back to the keyboard to read and scroll normally using the up, down, left and right arrows like a NORMAL RED FOX  We prefer the keyboard greatly over the mouse for ease of use, rather than being forced into switching back and forth from keyboard to mouse to keyboard from poor html coding regarding the 'FOCUS' (or is it simply the fault of the browser whose defaults regarding the 'FOCUS' have been ignored as far as productivity are concerned ?)  Every one of my financial institutions has changed over to some derivitive of a canned software package in which the home pages load with NO apparent Focus, the Username Field being many many random numbers of tab's from the initial 'lost focus' cursor position.   You are Forced to use the mouse to left click in the UserName Field, instead of being able to immediately use the keyboard to enter a username, etc.  Believe it or not, this amounts to quite a few hours of switching back and forth over a months period of time for us Which ='s Lost Productivity, time, and money.  HTML software coders, which in previous years, IMMEDIATELY placed the cursor (FOCUS) within the USERNAME FIELD, have lost their 'focus' or have never experienced or realized the purpose or availability (within coding libraries) of this simple, logical approach to coding any HTML.  If this feedback seems pointless to you, please, pass it off to someone who has been involved with web site creation and the publishing industry since, at least, the 70s up to and including the present.  Thanks very much !   ALSO:  It looks like the tab preview (when hovering over the FireFox TaskBar icon), is taking a very long time (rotating circular arrow) to create the site previews, up to minutes if you have more than 4 complex graphics intensive tabs open (i.e.: YouTube, commercial homepages with large graphical images, etc etc).  Maybe the thumbnails could be created upon opening, and stored immediately for later reference via the pop up taskbar icon previews.  I've shut off the option to display ALL tabs, and now only get the thumbnail of the last window with the focus.   o o thar's dat werd 'gin Jethro - Would like to see an option to display ONLY ONE TEXT LINE PER TAB representing each open tabs 'TITLE BAR' title.

Most common keyboard I use is ""command+enter(return)"" to complete .com urls. Same with ""shift+enter(return)"" for .net urls. However, with new release you have changed it to ""control+enter(return)"" which makes is soooo hard to use it. Because ""control"" button is only at the left side of the keyboard, no duplicate key on the right side of keyboard as ""command"". Which means it is harder to use this shortcut now with single hand. With said ""command"" in MacOS is the equivalent of ""ctrl"" of Windows. Almost every keyboard shortcut  with ""ctrl"" in Windows are shortcuts with ""cmd"" in MacOS. If you translate ""ctrl"" to ""control"", it means you are porting a Windows application to MacOS, not implementing a MacOS application. Also why do we need to change the behavior of this shortcut since the beginning of Firefox? You are removing every reason to use Firefox for me slowly, you are turning into Chrome which I hate.

However, I am being increasingly denied access to the world due to the fact that Firefox and others do not support moderately older operating systems and I can not afford a new operating system. The BBC , TED Talkls, and many government websites providing social services have had to redo their sites to accommodate all browsers.  Firefox can do that too.  I am using Firefox 48.0.2 and have a Mac 10.6.8 operating system. It does not seem congruent with the ideals of Firefox to not allow updates using systems such as mine. Imagine if wheel char ramps were constantly being modified and wheel chair users had to keep buying new wheel chairs to be able to have accessibility to buildings.  That is what it is like for those of us with disabilities who rely on the internet as our ""ramp to the world"" Net neutrality means nothing if you can't even get on the highway. Facebook has become unusable for me, which means that my entire social network is no longer available to me, leaving me in isolation, unable to engage with others.  That is frankly criminal in my view. I urge Firefox to supply updates which accommodate browsers more universally. I can not express to you how much pain, frustration, and anxiety this has caused me and how much of my time and energy, which I do not have enough of as it is, all this has wasted.

I'm fairly confident this browser crashes at least once every day. I am not exaggerating. It has not always done this. How much of this is the fault of the application and how much it is the fault of Android 8.0 is somewhat beyond me, but the browser is definitely not free of blame. I don't know when or how far back I got my first crashes, but through some sort of frog-boiling in water effect the frequency has reached this point.  It is abnormal for long pressing links to open an options menu to be impossible. This behavior has emerged in the past day or so. While it's been difficult, erratic and unpredictable before, especially on complex and badly programed sites like Tumblr, it has never before been so utterly impossible. The behavior that is taken rather than a long-press menu being displayed is text selection, which is the same behavior that would sometimes happen on links in the past, but is now seemingly consitent. This issue also extends to long-pressing images. And just clicking the links works fine.  An extension, ""dark background and light text"" is not working. This has been known to happen momentarily when the device is low on memory or the browser is otherwise stessed such as having very many tabs open, but not under more normal conditions.

And YOUR browser.  So I would like to know why the 'latest' version of firefox browser (as of Sunday 18/11/18) for Amazon Fire TV devices - 2nd generation Amazon Fire TV ('box' - NOT Stick or 'pendant box') - has a 'setting' that does the opposite of what it suggests i.e. there are only FOUR options in the settings of this browser. The FIRST option about 'user data' is NOT saved when the user selects to NOT send it, since after switching this option OFF, it is found to be ON again the next time they go into these settings to either read 'about', check 'privacy' or remove cookies etc.  You have also added something called 'Pocket', which I had neard heard of before & it is NOT removable, nor is there any 'setting' relating to it. I do NOT like it, nor do I want it.  This browser would have been much better with more user options that would ACTUALLY be saveable (like a choice of search engine & a 'home page' of users choice) rather than have changes made without reference to the user, that can't be reversed.  So I do NOT use a browser on Fire TV devices - as such I now can't view Youtube either since I don't like your browser.

I consider the feature a form of accessibility. I have used Firefox on Mac OS, Linux and Windows. It is familiar to me but I have relied on one particular feature on all platforms: the ability to override web page colors with user defined colors. I am currently using this feature with Firefox 63 on the Mac OS platform. It works well except for a few problems: 1. Text fields on websites are either a white background with black text, in spite of the colors specified in the Firefox preferences or, particularly with search fields on any website, it is black text in a black background. 2. The preferences window within Firefox is a standard white background with black text, which is difficult to read. It is not affected by the OS dark mode theme or user defined color preferences within Firefox. 3. Drop-down menus in forms are unaffected by user specified color preferences within Firefox. If the purpose of allowing users of Firefox to specify their own color themes for webpages is an accessibility feature, would you please address the aforementioned issues so that users may have a consistent experience with all aspects of Firefox?

McCoy Nov 18, 2018, 8:40:47 PM Hello curiouscat, You can no longer remove Firefox as your default browser in the Firefox menu => Preferences - all you have to do is to set your preferred browser as default on your system :  Go to Safari => Preferences. While on the General tab, select the browser you want to use as default from the drop down menu.  Then you'll see in Firefox's Preferences that Firefox is no longer the default browser.
